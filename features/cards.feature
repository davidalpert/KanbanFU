Feature: Cards API
  As as User
  I want to use the API to manage cards
  to administrate cards operations

  Background:
    Given I have the cards for project "1":
      | id | title            | description                       | started_on   | finished_on  | size | phase    |
      | 1  | Find a Sheriff   | Get a Sheriff everybody will hate | Nov 01, 2011 | Nov 5, 2011  | 2    | archive  |
      | 2  | Kill the Sheriff | Make the town kill the Sheriff    | Nov 06, 2011 |              | 1    | working  |

  Scenario: Listing cards for a project
    When I call API "/projects/1/cards"
    Then the response should be a collection of "cards" with:
      | id | title            | description                       | started_on   | finished_on  | size | phase    | blocked_time | waiting_time | blocked | waiting |
